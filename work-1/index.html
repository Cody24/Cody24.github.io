      Composing Digital Media has presented me with an experience unique to my college career. To this point, I haven’t done anything like this in any class. As an economics major, there isn’t a whole lot of emphasis on “looks” or any real kind of emphasis on some kind of website design. This has been a different kind of experience, and so far it is one that I have enjoyed. These are very valuable life skills we are learning, and presentation and functionality are important aspects of a product or of information. So, thus far in the class I have approached each assignment with a goal in mind, I want to understand exactly what it is that I am doing and how to improve on what I have already done. For instance, something that is unique so far is the relationship between HTML and CSS. My only programing experience is in statistical programming, so the only relationship I ever had to deal with was between the data and the specific command I used to get it. This class to this point is not that, it forces you to keep straight what you are doing on both sides or the product will simply not look right. As I said, this is new to me and I approached this assignment as such. The only way to get better at something is to take the criticism you receive and try to apply it to make your work better. Keeping that in mind, I adjusted my initial “About Me” section to include a more personal section to the end to keep the semi professional feel while leaving a little room for myself to show through, like what was suggested to me by the class.<br><br>
	My website to this point is still very much a work in progress, and I hope to employ some of the concepts we learn along the way to make it better than it is to this point. To this point I have focused mostly on the basic look and functionality. Personally, I prefer websites that are a little more minimalist in nature. To me, a website that lends itself to me quickly and easily finding what I want is an effective website. I tried to keep my own website true to that, while adding some basic aesthetic touches to help make the website look a little more pleasing to the eye. I changed the color of the background and headers to make sure they stood out through contrast, in addition to changing the font to one I thought was a little more pleasing. To make the website a little more quickly navigable, I built a sidebar navigation menu for all the links to the websites other pages because I thought it not only looked better, but made it quicker to find the information readers were looking for. To make it look a little less clunky, I also added a border around the outside of and between each of the available links. Going forward, I think my website could benefit from perhaps a little more color, as well as a few more design choices to help it look a little better like a roving sidebar or highlighted links.<br><br>
	From this point forward, there are a few specific areas where I would like to learn a little more. Most specifically, I would like to focus on design elements. One place I would like to focus is on color theory, as that was one of the areas I struggled with. Colors have been proven to effect people’s emotions in different ways and I think it would be interesting to understand not only that, but also what colors look nicer together, as I had my fair share of guess and check for that on the first portion of this project. In addition, I would also like to learn some basic JavaScript. While doing some research on design aspects I would like to add such as some border design and animations, I noticed that JavaScript was used to make it possible. I feel like learning JavaScript would not only be a beneficial for this project, but would also be another valuable skill for later in life. Lastly, I would like to learn how to use something like Photoshop. Photo editing would be a crucial part of website design, as images make for an effective tool to illustrate whatever it is that a website is trying to get across to it’s readers. For this specific website, photos would go a long way to making it a more personal experience, along with possibly making it a little more pleasing to the eye by adding a little more color to the page. Any of these design elements would go a long way to not only helping to make this website look better, but would also be useful to have for the future.

            <tr><td>1:00pm (2/19)  </td><td>3:00pm (2/19)</td><td>For this time slot, I rewatched the initial linda video introducing us to CSS that we watched for homework as a form of review of the basics.</td><td>This was simply more of a refresher.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3:00pm (2/19)  </td><td>3:30pm (2/19)</td><td>For this time slot, I watched Tutorial Video 5 about the addition of a sidebar, I was hoping to find a different way to work mine.</td><td>The sidebar is set up very similarly to my own, showing what is essentially a basic set up.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3:00pm (2/21)  </td><td>6:00pm (2/21)</td><td>I began watching the second Linda tutorial video of my sequence, CSS essential training one. My goal for viewing this video was to get a better sense of how to set up my site stylistically, I feel like some of my website is very awkwardly spaced out.</td><td>It was a pretty informative video, if the rest of the linda videos are like this one, then this will be a beneficial excercise. In all, this was very informative</td></tr>

    <h2>Reflection Post 2/23</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, this was a fairly busy week for me, as I had midterms in three seperate classes, so time was something that I didn't have an abundance of. Luckily however, I don't have very many classes next week and should not have that much work out of class, which should free up a lot of time to really get down to buisness. So far it's been an experience in reminder. Simply rewatching/watching what I have to this point has reminded me that I still have a very long way to go. I still need to go back and find time to really impliment what I have gone over so far on my site so hopeully I can impress myself a little bit and see some improvement towards my goal of having a truly professional looking website. Coming up, I am particularly excited about going over the color theory video I have, as I would like to know if what I have is a good color pallete going forward.</p>

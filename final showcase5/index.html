     <h2>Moment of Pride- Animation Fix</h2>
     <p>The thing that I am continually the most proud of is the animation I created for the front page of the website. When I showed it off in class, unfortunately, I didn’t have it correctly put together on any computer but my own laptop’s specific screen dimensions. In addition, when I sat down to fix it, I was unable to get my “spotlight” to work the way I had originally planned. Fortunately for me after playing around for a bit I was able to make it so that welcome was wrapped into my Keyframe. I did this to eliminate the spacing issue that each screen has, and now I have a cool batman style signal which adds a playful dynamic element to my website. I am very proud because even though it didn’t work exactly as I wanted, I was able to keep the animation and fix the spacing problem. I got creative and it worked out for me. As I get better with HTML and CSS going forward, obviously I hope that I start to be able to do whatever I put my mind to, but this was a very cool stepping stone that I am very proud of.</p>

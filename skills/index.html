    <h2>Skill Development</h2>
    <p>For this assignment, I would really like for my focus to be on web design, as it would be great if I could make my website look more professional then it currently does. For the self-guided skills assignment, I decided to grab 6 of the Linda videos off of your page that I thought would benefit me the most. I figured I would set aside time during each video to go in and actually apply what the material from each video which is where the extra time comes from. In addition, I felt like it was a good idea to go in and grab videos concerning what it is specifically that I would like to have in terms of design elements, such as videos concerning sidebars to improve on  the one I have. I also grabbed videos relating to the addition of images, as I would like to be able to put in some image elements as well, to go along with a few videos concerning web page set-up and design theory that I am sure I can draw on and benefit from. In addition, I thought it would be smart to have a video concerning color theory to help me figure out what the color situation of my website will be. Hopefully, these will help me take my website and make it look much more professional.<br>

From there is where I would like my focus to be. I would really like to be able to leave the class with a professional looking website. I would like my website to look like it could have been designed for a business. For me that’s a skill that I think would be applicable to my future profession, but not only that, it could serve as a platform to help sell me to prospective employers. Not only would it show in the work that I put into making the website, but hopefully it would also be able to highlight my versatility, which would never be a bad thing to showcase when trying to sell yourself. Hopefully, even though I am still new to this, the extra work shows through in the end product and I end with a website I could be proud showing off.<br><br>

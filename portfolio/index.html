    <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
    <p>Having now participated in this class all through the semester I can safely say that not only has my grasp of the concept of digital media grown and been revised, but I have learned a lot along the way.  I think that this progression shows in the work that I have done throughout the class, and now that I am looking back, I think the improvement shows. For example, if you remember my website during the first work in progress assignment, it was a cluttered, static, and blandly colored. Now, while still not perfect, I have a more streamlined menu for increased functionality, a front page animation to give it a slightly less static feel, and a color pallet that hopefully conveys a little more life. According to out text, “your job is to pay attention to the primary and secondary audiences” and, “what values or opinions do the primary or secondary audiences hold?” When I consider both audience sets, my primary audience is obviously you as my instructor, to which I had hoped to convey a more efficient, professional feel. However, my secondary audience is my peers, my classmates, who I show off the site to regularly. I see them on a more personal level, and I think that is a value that they hold, one that looks for engagement and interaction with my personality. So considering these two audiences, I was able to arrive at my current website design, hoping to convey a happy medium of these two plans. <br>
	I think that this revision towards a better, more fitting, final product is present in a lot of my work, displaying my improvement in creative or clever ways. For example, in class, we had a few assignments that involved trying to change the narrative of posters or ads by altering them in Photoshop. According to our readings, “Genre conventions help us to understand what audiences expect from particular kinds of texts in particular situations.” Now for this specific assignment, that meant that we went through and altered these specific genre conventions to give the media a new feel. I enjoyed this assignment, so for the second work in progress assignment, I altered an Avatar poster to try and create a horror movie. However, when I presented it to the class, the Photoshop application in some areas wasn’t overly clean, and the glowing red eyes and stereotypical font I chose felt forced and bordered on cheesy. So, I went back and further revised that work so that the horror flick vibe was still present, but it was also a little more subtle, so that the reader isn’t being hit in the face with the obvious. Not only that, but in addition, the actual Photoshop application seemed much better in some spots, further emphasizing to me at least that I was getting better and more comfortable with the technology. <br>
	While revision and improvement are central to my experience in this class so far, I think I would be remiss to not mention that this class was also one of entirely new experiences for me. I had never really worked with any kind of digital media at all, so it was pretty new and intriguing across the board. I think that the assignment I enjoyed the most for example was the soundscape, as it let me do something unique, but also to really play around with the narrative in a unique way. For example, it let me really tackle things like emphasis and indirect expression in a way that wasn’t at all visual. It makes you realize what a large role sound has on the way you perceive the world. For example, in my soundscape I made no reference at all to the location I wanted to present, but I was able to imply that it was taking place in space when I presented it to the class through the funky 1970s sci-fi sound. (For lack of a better descriptor.) I was also able to really emphasize the events that I wanted to be key in the storyline I created by dimming the background noises, varying the pitch, or changing the tempo of certain sounds, which I think worked towards conveying a very clear progression that I wanted to get across. What really made it cool though is that unlike in a lot of visual media, when I presented my soundscape to the class, there were a few different interpretations of what had happened, which I think is more likely then when given a form of media that is only perceived visually. <br>
	 While this class as a whole was one that was largely new to me, I think that it has accomplished what it set out to do. In the first few classes, it was made abundantly clear that not only was this class new to me, but it was new to most people. Knowing this, revision was made a key component of the class, be it through peer review, assignment submissions, or simply as part of everyday maintenance. Throughout the semester for example, we spent a lot of time going back and working similar projects with a new twist, which I think really allowed us to get more comfortable with the tools we were working with. Not only that, but we were forced to try and get them all to interact with one another on our website, which made us constantly continue to readjust and reassess. In addition, we were frequently asked to share what we had done with the class, which created a unique dialogue that allowed for the exchange of some neat fixes to problems, exposure to new ideas, or simply the ability to show off something someone was proud of. For me this was pretty much exactly what I needed. I am not one of those people who can know how to do things the first time I do it, so this worked out very well for me. Revision when working with something new is different. It makes you reassess what you’ve done, it makes you re-engage with the material, and what it accomplishes is growth. Because I had to revise so often, I am a lot more comfortable working with a lot of what we have done to this point. This class provided me with a very solid foundation for a lot of skills I didn’t have before, and I am happy about that.</p>

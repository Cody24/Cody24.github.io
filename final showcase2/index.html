<h2>Final Showcase</h2>
     <h2>Color and Fonts Decision</h2>
    <p>
	Currently, my website is trying to convey a sense of professionalism, but with a little more personality. The difference lies in the things like color, content, and font choice among other things. I made the decision to change my website to a blue color and add the front page animation to consciously make an effort to switched from the purely buisness style (Darker/Text Heavy) I began with. However, this switch was only really possible because of the assignment at hand. For example, if I were trying to design a website for a bank for example, I would create a more static design with neutral colors to convey a more buttoned up kind of appearance. I would go for an informative, streamlined website that is simplistic yet informative. However, if I were designing for a vacation/travel website, I would design it to be colorful, with lots of pictures to try and convey an enjoyable, carefree atmosphere. I would include plenty of pictures as well just to really drive home the point. My website was designed to be a sort of cross between those two, and hopefully it came out that way.</p>

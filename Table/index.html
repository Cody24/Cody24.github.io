            <tr><td>1:00pm (2/19)  </td><td>3:00pm (2/19)</td><td>For this time slot, I rewatched the initial linda video introducing us to CSS that we watched for homework as a form of review of the basics.</td><td>This was simply more of a refresher.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3:00pm (2/19)  </td><td>3:30pm (2/19)</td><td>For this time slot, I watched Tutorial Video 5 about the addition of a sidebar, I was hoping to find a different way to work mine.</td><td>The sidebar is set up very similarly to my own, showing what is essentially a basic set up.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3:00pm (2/21)  </td><td>6:00pm (2/21)</td><td>I began watching the second Linda tutorial video of my sequence, CSS essential training one. My goal for viewing this video was to get a better sense of how to set up my site stylistically, I feel like some of my website is very awkwardly spaced out.</td><td>It was a pretty informative video, if the rest of the linda videos are like this one, then this will be a beneficial excercise. In all, this was very informative</td></tr>
            <tr><td>4:00pm (2/26)  </td><td>4:30pm (2/26) </td><td> I watched the graphic design color video in this segment to see if the colors I had used ould work well.  </td><td> What I found was actually that what I had picked worked out pretty well, so after playing around with a few other color combinations, I decided to keep what I had for now because I liked it and I am not sure it goes against my overall design goals. Obviously however, it could change to a slightly darker color scheme at some point. </td>
            <tr><td>3:00pm (2/28) </td><td>5:00pm (2/28)</td><td>I began the five hour long HTML essentials video. </td><td> I think I am starting to get the hang of what I am doing in html. Honestly, it no longer seems overly complicated.
            <tr><td>6:00pm (3/1) </td><td>9:00pm (3/1) </td><td> I wrapped up the video and took some notes along the way. </td><td> I am looking forward to spring break where I can sit down and actively go and rework my website with some new material.</td>
            <tr><td>10:30pm (3/3) </td><td> 11:00pm (3/3) </td><td> I spent about a half hour adjusting some of the stuff for my table trying to clean it up a bit. </td><td> In the end, I think my table is starting to look pretty nice. I added a border and adjusted the spacing to make it look a little better and I centered the text for clarity purposes.</td>
              <tr><td> 11:00am (3/5) </td><td> 2:00pm (3/5) </td><td> For this time slot, I watched the CSS essentials 2 video. </td><td> While watching this video, I actually went back and checked how I had set up my CSS page in terms of the actual alignment of my sidebar and realized that while it had gotten the job done, I had not chosen the most overly efficent way to line everything up. I should have used the inline fomatting instead of the float formatting. I created unnecessary headaches for myself. </td>
                <tr><td> 2:00pm (3/6) </td><td> 5:00pm (3/6) </td><td> I watched the linda videos for the course CSS essentials 3. </td><td> In this sections of videos I had a pretty eye opening experience. I had thought that HTML and CSS was simply for formatting, and while it does come with a limit, it can also create basic animations. I had previously thought that you needed some sort of JavaScript to do anything like that. In addition, the lesson goes over issues like getting images to appear clear on high pixl screens and things like that.</td>
              <tr><td> 1:00pm (3/8) </td><td> 3:00pm (3/8) </td><td> I watched the important sections of the Design Aesethics for the Web video. </td><td> The portions of this video that I watched focused on the eight elements of design and what effect each element has on the look and feel of the page. </td>
             <tr><td> 8:00am (3/13) </td><td> 9:00am (3/13) </td><td> My goal in this time slot was just some website clean up. </td><td> Here, I cleaded up my table page, input a resume onto my front page, fixed typos, and changed the color scheme of my website from the yellow to try and create more of a calming professional feel.</td>
            <tr><td> 9:00am (3/16) </td><td> 1:00pm (3/16) </td><td> I spent this time really ironing out my front page. </td><td> I spent a long time building my home page. I thought it would be very cool to build a spotlight animation to really highlight the welcome on my opening page. I had to make sure to layer the white cirle so it would slide behind my text. Unfortunately, even though it lines up perfectly on my own computer, it doesnt line up exactly on every single monitor size, so a large monitor might have it slid over a little farther to one side of the word. </td>

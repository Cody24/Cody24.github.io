            <tr><td>1:00pm (2/19)  </td><td>3:00pm (2/19)</td><td>For this time slot, I rewatched the initial linda video introducing us to CSS that we watched for homework as a form of review of the basics.</td><td>This was simply more of a refresher.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3:00pm (2/19)  </td><td>3:30pm (2/19)</td><td>For this time slot, I watched Tutorial Video 5 about the addition of a sidebar, I was hoping to find a different way to work mine.</td><td>The sidebar is set up very similarly to my own, showing what is essentially a basic set up.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3:00pm (2/21)  </td><td>6:00pm (2/21)</td><td>I began watching the second Linda tutorial video of my sequence, CSS essential training one. My goal for viewing this video was to get a better sense of how to set up my site stylistically, I feel like some of my website is very awkwardly spaced out.</td><td>It was a pretty informative video, if the rest of the linda videos are like this one, then this will be a beneficial excercise. In all, this was very informative</td></tr>
            <tr><td>4:00pm (2/26)  </td><td>4:30pm (2/26) </td><td> I watched the graphic design color video in this segment to see if the colors I had used ould work well.  </td><td> What I found was actually that what I had picked worked out pretty well, so after playing around with a few other color combinations, I decided to keep what I had for now because I liked it and I am not sure it goes against my overall design goals. Obviously however, it could change to a slightly darker color scheme at some point. </td>
            <tr><td>3:00pm (2/28) </td><td>5:00pm (2/28)</td><td>I began the five hour long HTML essentials video. </td><td> I think I am starting to get the hang of what I am doing in html. Honestly, it no longer seems overly complicated.
            <tr><td>6:00pm (3/1) </td><td>9:00pm (3/1) </td><td> I wrapped up the video and took some notes along the way. </td><td> I am looking forward to spring break where I can sit down and actively go and rework my website with some new material.</td><td>
            <tr><td>10:30pm (3/3) </td><td> 11:00pm (3/3) </td><td> I spent about a half hour adjusting some of the stuff for my table trying to clean it up a bit. </td><td> In the end, I think my table is starting to look pretty nice. I added a border and adjusted the spacing to make it look a little better and I centered the text for clarity purposes.</td>
              <tr><td> 11:00am (3/5) </td><td> 2:00pm (3/5) </td><td> For this time slot, I watched the CSS essentials 2 video. </td><td> While watching this video, I actually went back and checked how I had set up my CSS page in terms of the actual alignment of my sidebar and realized that while it had gotten the job done, I had not chosen the most overly efficent way to line everything up. I should have used the inline fomatting instead of the float formatting. I created unnecessary headaches for myself. </td>

    <h2>Reflection Post 2/23</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, this was a fairly busy week for me, as I had midterms in three seperate classes, so time was something that I didn't have an abundance of. Luckily however, I don't have very many classes next week and should not have that much work out of class, which should free up a lot of time to really get down to buisness. So far it's been an experience in reminder. Simply rewatching/watching what I have to this point has reminded me that I still have a very long way to go. I still need to go back and find time to really impliment what I have gone over so far on my site so hopeully I can impress myself a little bit and see some improvement towards my goal of having a truly professional looking website. Coming up, I am particularly excited about going over the color theory video I have, as I would like to know if what I have is a good color pallete going forward.</p>
        <h2>Reflection Post 3/2</h2>
              <p>This week was a little less busy for me, and I was able to do some work on three seperate days. I decided I should probably address the very long HTML essentials video, in addition to the color theory video. Today I have actually changed my opinion of what I want my website to look like. I've decided that there really arent any websites that are meant to be professional in nature that are bright yellow, and while the color combination might be pleasing to the eye, it doesnt portray the most proffessional feel. For that reason, I think over the weekend I am going to try and tone the website down to some more nuetral colors. In addition, I have some new design elements that I hope to implement to the page. Ideally, I hope to make my table look much better, because right now it is a little of a disorganized disaster. In addition, I would like to clean up my sidebar so the spacing and border lines work a little better. I would also really like to make it a floating sidebar, so that as you scroll down the page the navigation center follows, which should make it more convient for the user.<br><br>
              I think that I will also end up adjusting my training regimen. It came to my attention that it might take a lot more time for me to actually implement what I have written down, which I didn't completely include in a lot of my video times on the initial bulleted list. So going forward, as I begin to impliment these changes, I am going to include the work time in the schedule. It will be exciting for me I think to see the differences in the site going forward.</p>

I should have used the inline fomatting instead of the float formatting. I created unnecessary headaches for myself. </td>

I had thought that HTML and CSS was simply for formatting, and while it does come with a limit, it can also create basic animations. I had previously thought that you needed some sort of JavaScript to do anything like that. In addition, the lesson goes over issues like getting images to appear clear on high pixl screens and things like that.</td>

    <h2>Final Reflection Post 3/13</h2>
    <p>	In the assignment goals for this exercise, the predominant goal to me was to build core competencies in the area of study. While still not exactly a master in the HTML and CSS fields, building core competencies in the area is something that I think I have absolutely accomplished. This was a big goal of mine, as it was a skill that I think could benefit me in my search for employment more so then the other options. To me, this was a valuable skill that I could see using and prior to the start of this assignment, wasn’t something that I would have felt comfortable claiming I had experience in just from the base class.<br><br>
 In the beginning of the class, I had no experience in the area, and when I was building the website for the class it absolutely showed. It took me a very long time to go about really accomplishing anything, as I would kind of sit there and fumble around until I accomplished what I was looking for. While there are still times when I go about solving issues by trial and error, they happen less often and are usually not as prolonged. I think that the sort of guess and check mentality I went about doing things with shows up in the code of the website. When I went back and looked at it, I noticed that I had some very roundabout ways of going about accomplishing things. For instance, in some situations I was using the float parameters in combination with a bunch of different paddings to try and get items on my website to be situated how I wanted, when I could have saved myself a lot of time by simply using the inline functions.<br><br>
Not only did I clarify areas where I wasn’t exactly the model of efficiency, but I also ended up learning new things that I wasn’t aware that I could accomplish using HTML and CSS. For example, over spring break, I learned that I could do basic animations, which is something I was unaware of. I actually that I would need to have some base knowledge of JavaScript, and while for something actually extravagant I would need that knowledge, I can do basic animations, so I look forward to including that somewhere in my website before Friday in my finished product. <br><br>
One of the things I found that worked well for me was to watch the video and try and take it in, then go back later and try and implement it in my website. I realize that this is not a practical concept, and makes for some overlap where I had to go back and find a specific topic in my tutorials again for clarification. However, this did accomplish one big thing for me in making me think about HTML and CSS on a more consistent basis and try and work through some of the issues I was having without help. One of the areas where I think I struggled initially was that we would go to class and talk about the topic and move on as it was only a once a week class. For me this meant that I was only really interacting with the material once or twice a week if we had some sort of out of class work. This project forced this to be something that I would think about and interact with on a much more regular basis, meaning I retained some of the processes much better and could build on that knowledge. <br><br>
I also definitely had some things that didn’t work for me very well at all. I had videos from a few different sources, to go along with what I built in my website from the initial skeleton provided in class. One of the things that I learned is that there are a lot of different ways to go about doing things in HTML and some of these ways don’t overlap particularly well. I would pretty frequently try and adjust things to the specifications of my tutorials, but it wouldn’t work as intended because of the way I had already accomplished things. This lead to a lot of guess and check spacing adjustments that just got kind of frustrating, especially towards the beginning of the assignment. I think that this might be why I started to really focus in on the Lynda videos towards the end because of the uniformity, and the continuity present between videos while I learned how to really go about doing things.<br><br>
If I were to do this project over, I think that I would try to build the website from scratch, using the Lynda videos as my guide. I think this would make a do-over much easier simply for continuities sake, and it might have helped my website to be a little more streamlined. All in all though if I were to have a redo I would choose the same topic again. I am glad that I chose HTML and CSS as my area of individual study, and it definitely paid off in my understanding of the subject. I am glad that individual study was a teaching method used in this course as I really do think that you only really learn when you are forced to put something together for yourself.

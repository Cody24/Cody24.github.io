     <h2>Frustrating Thing- Streamlined Menu</h2>
     <p>This was quite possibly the most frustrating revision I had to make was the streamlining of my menu. It took a very long time and involved a lot of going in and out of different web pages to make sure everything was organized the way I wanted as I went. In an effort to make a more streamlined menu to eliminate the disorganization in my menu bar and make it more user friendly, I dramatically cut down on the links. I created a menu that would only display the five main pages, and then the sub pages underneath if there were more pages in the section. Now, my website should be easier to navigate, and quite frankly, it needed the revision. I had initially planned on making an expanding accordion menu, but all I could come up with were examples that needed JavaScript, and I was unable to figure that out. However, I got creative, in what sees to be a recurring lesson in fixing the problems I come across, it just took a while to fix. Instead of the accordion menu, I simply used space and dividing lines to illustrate the new menus, and I didnâ€™t need JavaScript for that.</p>

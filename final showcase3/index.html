<h2>Final Showcase</h2>
     <h2>Comparison-Logo</h2>
     <p>In class, we spent some time discussing what makes for an effective logo, and we went over some of the logos for businesses who have gone under in recent years. What we do know is that some simple things, such as making someone think about the logo for a little longer is an effective form of advertising. In addition, having something that effectively conveys what you do can clear up some confusion a potential customer may have about your business. Long story short, an effective logo can be very important. For this particular section, I have decided to show off the logo I created in comparison with the original logo for Zenith. I decided to try and play the clever side of things when I shifted everything around and made the attempt to put Zenith on the actual zenith of the makeshift mountain I created. I kept a lot of the same elements for continuities sake, but I tried to give it a fresh take and I think it was successful. I think it highlights what could be done with a few simple changes. If further revisions were made, and they absolutely could be because frankly, I am no expert, I think there could be change the tag line to something that explains what it is that they do in more layman terms, so they can convey what they do to everyone.</p>

<h2>Final Showcase</h2>

    <h2>Genre Choice</h2>
    <p>In class, we talked for a while about what helped to convey the genre that a specific media was trying to convey, such as tones of color and different font styles. In class, we did an activity to try and represent that, where we made our own attempt to change the genre through alterations like those. I had a good time doing that, so for my work in progress two revision I made an attempt to do this solo by turning an avatar movie poster into a vampire poster, turning it into a horror movie. I did this by altering the color scheme to more black and gray, changing the font type to something a little more foreboding in nature, and providing an uneasy subtitle to name a few. Unfortunately, my original attempt wasnâ€™t the cleanest work, so I made another attempt at a revision, employing a lot of the same methods. Hopefully, this shift would lead the viewer to believe they were about to step into a thriller, one in which they would feel uneasy at every corner. For an expert, I might try to add some more subtlety into the poster, maybe something that makes people subconsciously uneasy, but for the general person, I feel like the poster accomplishes the message I am trying to convey.

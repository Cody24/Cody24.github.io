<h2>Reflection Post 3/2</h2>
              <p>This week was a little less busy for me, and I was able to do some work on three seperate days. I decided I should probably address the very long HTML essentials video, in addition to the color theory video. Today I have actually changed my opinion of what I want my website to look like. I've decided that there really arent any websites that are meant to be professional in nature that are bright yellow, and while the color combination might be pleasing to the eye, it doesnt portray the most proffessional feel. For that reason, I think over the weekend I am going to try and tone the website down to some more nuetral colors. In addition, I have some new design elements that I hope to implement to the page. Ideally, I hope to make my table look much better, because right now it is a little of a disorganized disaster. In addition, I would like to clean up my sidebar so the spacing and border lines work a little better. I would also really like to make it a floating sidebar, so that as you scroll down the page the navigation center follows, which should make it more convient for the user.<br><br>
              I think that I will also end up adjusting my training regimen. It came to my attention that it might take a lot more time for me to actually implement what I have written down, which I didn't completely include in a lot of my video times on the initial bulleted list. So going forward, as I begin to impliment these changes, I am going to include the work time in the schedule. It will be exciting for me I think to see the differences in the site going forward.</p>
